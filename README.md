### Unnamed _Yakuza_ fangame (Game Boy)

- Made using [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/), a software dedicated to easily developing a Game Boy game (that can be played on _real hardware!_)
- A simple endless beat-em-up adapting the world and simplifying the combat of the _Yakuza_ franchise, using both a top-down perspective for overworld exploration and 2D sections for random encounters, similar to _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_.

### Personal Website

- Run through Github website hosting
- Simple site to aggregate various links I find important to have in one place
- Intended as a refresher for HTML/CSS skills garnered in middle and high school
